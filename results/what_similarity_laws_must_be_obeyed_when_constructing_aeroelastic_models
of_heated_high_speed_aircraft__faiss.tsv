  the similarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing are presented
in the range .  these are obtained by
making nondimensional the appropriate governing equations of
the individual external aerodynamic flow, heat conduction to
the interior, and stress-deflection problems which make up the
combined aerothermoelastic problem .
  for the general aerothermoelastic model, where the model is
placed in a high-stagnation-temperature wind tunnel, similitude
is shown to be very difficult to achieve for a scale ratio other
than unity .  the primary conflict occurs between the
free-stream mach number reynolds number aeroelastic
parameter heat conduction parameter and
thermal expansion parameter .
  means of dealing with this basic conflict are presented .  these
include (1) looking at more specialized situations, such as the
behavior of wing structures and of thin solid plate lifting surfaces,
and panel flutter, where the aerothermoelastic similarity
parameters assume less restrictive forms, (2) the use of /incomplete
aerothermoelastic/ testing in which the pressure and/or heating
rates are estimated in advance and applied artificially to the
model, and (3) the use of /restricted purpose/ models
investigating separately one or another facet of the complete
aerothermoelastic problem .
  some numerical examples of modeling for the general
aerothermoelastic case as well as for the specialized situations
mentioned in (1) above are given .

can decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinders

transfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller than

expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on

reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by

comprised of commercially available components .

1.2425795	688	no	"tables of aerodynamic coefficients obtained from developed newtonian
expressions for complete and partial conic and spheric bodies at
combined angles of attack and sideslip with some comparisons with
hypersonic experimental data .
closed-form expressions and tables composed from these expressions are
presented for complete and partial conic and spheric bodies at combined
angles of attack and sideslip in newtonian flow . aerodynamic
coefficients of these bodies are tabulated for various body segments
over a range of angles of attack from 1degree to 85degree and angles of
sideslip from 0degree to 15degree .
some comparisons between newtonian predictions and hypersonic
experimental aerodynamic characteristics were made for conic bodies
having various surface slopes, nose bluntnesses, and body cross sections
 to indicate the range of validity of the theory . in general, the
theory is shown to agree quite well with experimental results for
sharp-nose complete cones and for configurations having large blunted
noses and steep surface slopes . however, agreement between theory and
experiment generally is poor for the more slender, slightly blunted
complete or half conic bodies and also for sharp-nose half conic bodies
where real-flow phenomena such as forebody interference, viscous forces,
 leeward surface contributions, or leading-edge pressure reductions may
have significant effect . the agreement between theory and experiment
for the bodies considered can be improved by using the stagnation
pressure coefficient behind a normal shock rather than 2 as the newtonian
coefficient, although for the sharp-nose half conic bodies there is no
theoretical justification for this modification ."

boundary layer equations .
  the compressibility transformation first introduced by
dorod-nitzyn has been applied in this paper to the equations of the
turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate, considering heat transfer
and arbitrary prandtl numbers .  assuming the shear
distribution to be invariant under the transformation, the stream
function and the momentum equation take the proper form for
incompressible flow, allowing the use of incompressible velocity
profiles in the transformed coordinates .  application of crocco's
method to the transformed energy equation permits integration
of the energy equation resulting in a formulism remarkably
similar to that proposed by eckert .  finally, the reference
condition was chosen to correspond to the edge of the sublayer from
considerations of the assumptions made regarding the
shear-stress distribution .  with this choice, the reference enthalpy is in
good agreement with eckert's formula over the ordinary range of
test conditions .  in view of these results, the analysis may be
considered to provide a theoretical basis for the
reference-enthalpy method ."

numbers of 6. 8 and 9. 6.
  measurements are presented for pressure
gradients induced by a laminar boundary layer on a
flat plate in air at a mach number of 9.6 and for the
drag of thin wings at a mach number of about 6.8
and zero angle of attack .  the pressure
measurements at a mach number of 9.6 were made in the
presence of substantial heat transfer from the
boundary layer to the plate surface .  the measured
pressure distribution on the surface of the plate was
predicted with good accuracy by a modification to
insulated-plate displacement theory which allows
for the effect of the heat transfer and temperature
gradient along the surface on the boundary-layer
displacement thickness .
  the total drag of thin wings with square and delta
plan forms was measured at a nominal mach number
of 6.8 over a reasonably wide range of reynolds
numbers .  the total drag was found to be greater
than can be explained by adding a classical value of
laminar skin friction to the estimated pressure drag .
the difference is, in general, explained by the
increase in skin friction (20 to 40 percent) caused by
the boundary-layer-induced pressures ."

  the matrix force method of redundant

one of these is the non-linear analysis

might be used in advanced flight vehicles .
in this case the approach used
by the present authors is equally applicable
to shallow shells, the
formulation of the strain-displacement and
equilibrium relations being a
finite element equivalent to that used
by marguerre .  the solution is
obtained by a combined iteration and step

tangent flexibility matrix .  divergence
